                completion of
                a transaction. It outlines the details of the goods or services to be provided, including descriptions,
                quantities, prices, and terms of sale. Unlike a commercial invoice, a proforma invoice is not a legally
                binding document but serves as a quotation or an estimate of costs. It allows the buyer to review and
                confirm the details of the transaction before finalizing the purchase.Proforma invoices are commonly
                used in international trade to facilitate negotiations, customs clearance, and secure financing or
                letters of credit.</p>
